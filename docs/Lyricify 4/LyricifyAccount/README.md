# Lyricify Account

The Lyricify account is the necessary credential for you to get, mark, and upload lyrics. Only when you have a Lyricify account and the status is normal, you can perform server operations such as uploading lyrics.

## Lyricify account registration
Your Lyricify account is linked to the Spotify account you log into on Lyricify. When you log into your Spotify account on Lyrcify for the first time, Lyricify will automatically register the associated Lyricify account.
After you complete the Spotify account authorization, if Lyricify prompts `You are No. n Lyricify user`, it means that your Spotify account has been successfully registered and associated on the Lyricify server. Can be used normally.
If after completing the Spotify account authorization, Lyricify prompts `Failed to register on Lyricify server. Server side functions might be limited. A re-login might solve this issue.` which indicates that Lyricify account registration failed, or this link failed. If you have not used Lyricify 4 before, or have used it before, but it does not display `You are No. n Lyricify user`, it means that the Lyricify account registration failed. You can try the following:
1. If you are using a proxy, you can close it and try again.
2. Change the network environment and ensure that `e.wxriw.cn` can be accessed. You can test it by accessing `http://e.wxriw.cn:22608/app/connection-test`. If OK is returned, the connection is normal.

Note: The `try again` mentioned above refers to logging out of Lyricify and re-authorizing the login.

## Lyricify account is restricted
Lyricify accounts that violate Lyricify Lyrics Vault regulations will be restricted when reported by users or discovered by Lyricify managers.
If your Lyricify account has been restricted, don't panic; you can request to have the restriction removed by contacting a member of the Lyricify admin team. We will tell you the reasons and specific tracks that led to the restriction. We will unblock your account after you relearn the Lyricify Lyrics Vault rules.

## General limitations of Lyricify accounts
In order to protect the Lyricify Lyrics Vault and server, Lyricify accounts only have permission to access the Lyricify Lyrics Vault within 24 hours after completing the registration, but do not have the permission to upload lyrics to the Lyricify Lyrics Vault. If it prompts `Your upload request has been denied` and the account registration time is within 24 hours, you need to wait patiently.
If you encounter `Part of the upload has failed, please try again later` when uploading, it means that you have uploaded too many times in a short period of time. It is recommended to wait 2-3 hours and try again.

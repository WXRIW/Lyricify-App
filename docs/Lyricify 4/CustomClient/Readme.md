## Benefits from customising Spotify API Client
Spotify API won't affect you by returning 429 Error anymore.

## Preparations
If you have already completed the preparation steps, you can directly use the previously obtained `Client ID` and `Client Secret` in `Works on Lyricify` part.
1. Login to Spotify (https://www.spotify.com) in your browser, if you have already logged in, go to step 2.
2. Open https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard, if this is your first navigation to this website, you will need to agree with Spotify Developer Terms. Just check `I accept the Spotify Developer Terms of Service` and click `Accept the terms`.

3. Click `Create app` in Dashboard's right top corner.  
   If you are prompted with `You need to verify your email address before you can create an app.`, you need to verify your email address first.

# Common Issues

## Error during authorization: INVALID_CLIENT: Invalid redirect URI
Please check if the `Redirect URI` is entered correctly. Make sure it includes `http://127.0.0.1:766/callback` and **not** `https://127.0.0.1:766/callback`.

### Important Note
If you **created and configured your custom API Client before April 9, 2025**, please make sure to update your app settings in the Spotify Developer Dashboard. Due to recent changes in Spotify's redirect URI validation, **URIs using `localhost` are no longer accepted**. You need to replace the original:

```
http://localhost:766/callback
```

with:

```
http://127.0.0.1:766/callback
```

Go to your app’s settings page, and add `http://127.0.0.1:766/callback` under the **Redirect URIs** section. Once updated, your custom API Client should work properly during authorization.

> ⚠️ Note: `127.0.0.1` is the IP address equivalent of `localhost`. Under Spotify's current validation rules, `127.0.0.1` is accepted, while `localhost` is not.
